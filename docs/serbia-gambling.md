# GDPR-Compliant Gambling Player Registry System: Complete Technical Specification

## Executive Summary

This document provides a production-ready technical specification for a GDPR-compliant gambling player registry system for Serbia, designed to scale from 1,000 players (community level) to millions of players (national level). The system balances EU GDPR requirements with Serbian domestic gambling and data protection laws while implementing international best practices in player protection.

[FULL DOCUMENT CONTINUES - Due to length, I'll provide the complete specification in structured sections]

## PART 3 (CONTINUED): Data Subject Rights Implementation

### 3.5 Right of Access (Article 15)

**Implementation Requirements:**

**Response Timeline:** 30 days (extendable to 90 days if complex)

**Information to Provide:**
- Confirmation of processing
- Categories of personal data
- Purposes of processing
- Recipients or categories of recipients
- Retention periods
- Data subject rights
- Right to lodge complaint with DPA
- Source of data (if not from player)
- Automated decision-making details

**Implementation in Player Registry:**

```
1. Player submits access request via API or portal
2. Identity verification (two-factor authentication)
3. System generates comprehensive data package:
   - Player profile (JSON)
   - Transaction history (CSV)
   - Limits and exclusions (JSON)
   - Consents (JSON with full history)
   - Audit logs (CSV - redacted for third parties)
   - Processing purposes document (PDF)
4. Encrypt package with player's key or password
5. Make available for download for 30 days
6. Log access request in audit trail
7. Notify player of completion
```

**Self-Service Portal:**
- Player dashboard showing transaction history (last 3 months)
- Real-time limit consumption
- Active consents
- Full data export button

---

### 3.6 Right to Rectification (Article 16)

**Implementation:**

```
1. Player identifies incorrect data field
2. Provides corrected value + supporting documentation
3. System verifies correction against KYC requirements
4. If low-risk field (address typo): Immediate update
5. If high-risk field (DOB, ID number): Manual review + re-verification
6. Update all systems and notify player
7. Cascade corrections to all operators if centralized registry
8. Log rectification in audit trail
```

**Restrictions:**
- Cannot change ID number without re-verification
- Cannot change DOB if affects age verification
- Cannot change transaction history (immutable)

---

### 3.7 Right to Erasure (Article 17)

**Serbian Context - Limited Applicability:**

**5-Year Retention Overrides Most Requests:**
- Serbian gambling law requires 5-year minimum retention
- Applies to: Player databases, transaction records, entry/exit logs

**When Erasure Applies:**
- Marketing data (immediate)
- Non-essential cookies (immediate)
- Data beyond 5-year retention period
- Data processed unlawfully

**Partial Erasure Implementation:**

```
Player requests erasure:
1. Check retention obligations
2. Identify erasable vs. retained data:
   
   IMMEDIATE ERASURE:
   - Marketing preferences
   - Optional profile fields (gender, preferences)
   - Cached data
   - Non-essential tracking cookies
   
   RETAINED (5 years):
   - Core identity data (name, DOB, ID number)
   - Transaction records
   - KYC documents
   - Self-exclusion records
   - Audit logs
   
3. Pseudonymize retained data where possible
4. Add to marketing suppression list
5. Document exemptions applied
6. Notify player of partial erasure
7. Schedule full erasure for 5-year expiry date
```

---

### 3.8 Right to Restriction (Article 18)

**Triggers:**
- Accuracy contested (pending verification)
- Processing unlawful but player opposes erasure
- No longer needed but player needs for legal claim
- Player objected (pending verification of grounds)

**Implementation:**

```
1. Player requests restriction
2. Flag account as "restricted"
3. Limit processing to:
   - Storage only
   - Consent-based processing
   - Legal claims defense
   - Protection of another person's rights
   - Important public interest reasons
4. Block:
   - Profiling
   - Automated decisions
   - Marketing
   - New transactions (if gambling account)
5. Notify third parties of restriction
6. Review restriction periodically
7. Lift restriction when conditions resolved
```

---

### 3.9 Right to Data Portability (Article 20)

**Scope:**
- Only data processed on **consent** or **contract** basis
- Only data **provided by player** or **observed behavior**

**EXCLUDED from Portability:**
- Risk scores (derived/inferred data)
- AML flags
- Fraud indicators
- Internal notes
- Data processed on legitimate interest or legal obligation

**Portable Data in Player Registry:**
- Player profile (name, DOB, contact)
- Preferences (language, currency, notifications)
- Transaction history
- Self-set limits
- Marketing consents (if consent-based)
- Login history

**Export Format:**

**Implementation:**

```json
{
  "export_metadata": {
    "player_id": "player_abc123xyz",
    "export_date": "2024-10-27T15:00:00Z",

## PART 4: Player Protection Implementation Guidance

### 4.1 Self-Exclusion System Implementation

**Technical Requirements:**

1. **Multi-Duration Options:**
   - 24 hours (minimum - Serbian requirement)
   - 7 days
   - 30 days
   - 6 months
   - 1 year
   - 5 years
   - Permanent (indefinite)

2. **Irreversibility:**
   - Cannot be cancelled during period
   - System-enforced locks
   - No operator override capability
   - Only exception: Court order or DPA directive

3. **Cooling-Off After Expiry:**
   - 7-day default (UK GamStop standard)
   - Advance notification: 7 days and 24 hours before expiry
   - Active removal required (not automatic)

4. **Cross-Operator Enforcement:**
```
Player self-excludes:
1. Immediate API call to central registry
2. Registry broadcasts to all licensed operators via webhooks
3. Operators must block within 24 hours (Serbian requirement)
4. Real-time verification at login/deposit
5. Attempted breaches logged and reported
```

5. **Verification at Key Points:**
   - Account registration
   - Login (optional but recommended)
   - Before first deposit
   - Before bet placement (Germany OASIS standard)
   - Daily background checks

**API Integration Example:**

```javascript
// Operator checks exclusion before allowing play
async function checkExclusion(nationalId, dateOfBirth) {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.playerregistry.rs/v1/exclusion-checks', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + accessToken,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      nationalIdNumber: nationalId,
      dateOfBirth: dateOfBirth,
      operatorId: 'operator_abc123'
    })
  });
  
  const result = await response.json();
  
  if (result.data.excluded) {
    // Block player from gambling
    displayExclusionMessage(result.data.exclusionDetails.endDate);
    logAttemptedBreach(nationalId);
    return false;
  }
  
  return true; // Allow play
}
```

---

### 4.2 Limit Management Implementation

**Deposit Limits:**

**Netherlands Model (Age-Differentiated):**
```
Age 18-24:
- Baseline: €150/month
- Maximum: €300/month (with duty-of-care check)

Age 25+:
- Baseline: €350/month
- Maximum: €700/month
- Above €700: Full financial well-being check required
```

**Spain Model (Centralized):**
```
Daily: €600
Weekly: €1,500
Monthly: €3,000
Increases: 3-day cooling-off period
Frequency: Maximum one change per quarter
```

**Implementation Logic:**

```python
def check_deposit_limit(player_id, proposed_amount, currency):
    # Get all active limits for player
    limits = get_player_limits(player_id, limit_type='deposit')
    
    for limit in limits:
        period = limit['period']  # daily, weekly, monthly
        max_amount = limit['amount']
        current_consumption = calculate_consumption(player_id, period)
        
        if current_consumption + proposed_amount > max_amount:
            return {
                'allowed': False,
                'reason': f'{period} limit exceeded',
                'limit': max_amount,
                'current': current_consumption,
                'proposed': proposed_amount,
                'exceeded_by': (current_consumption + proposed_amount) - max_amount
            }
    
    return {'allowed': True}

def calculate_consumption(player_id, period):
    if period == 'daily':
        start_date = today_midnight()
    elif period == 'weekly':
        start_date = this_week_start()
    elif period == 'monthly':
        start_date = this_month_start()
    
    # Net calculation: Deposits - Withdrawals
    deposits = sum_deposits(player_id, start_date, now())
    withdrawals = sum_withdrawals(player_id, start_date, now())
    
    return max(0, deposits - withdrawals)  # Cannot be negative
```

**Limit Change Rules:**

```
DECREASE:
- Effective immediately
- No cooling-off period
- Player can decrease anytime

INCREASE:
- 24-72 hour cooling-off period (jurisdiction-dependent)
- Spain: 3 days
- UK: 24 hours minimum
- Notify player of pending change
- Can cancel increase during cooling-off
- Effective after cooling-off expires
- Requires duty-of-care assessment if significant increase

REMOVAL:
- Treated as increase to infinity
- Same cooling-off as increase
- May require additional confirmation
```

---

### 4.3 Reality Checks Implementation

**UK Requirements:**

1. **Frequency:**
   - Player-selectable: 15, 30, 45, 60 minutes
   - Default to minimum (15 minutes) if not set
   - Cannot be disabled completely

2. **Content Display:**
   - Time elapsed since session start
   - Total wagered this session
   - Net win/loss this session
   - Current balance
   - Links to responsible gambling tools
   - "Continue Playing" or "Take a Break" buttons

3. **Behavior:**
   - Pop-up overlay (cannot be auto-dismissed)
   - Player must actively acknowledge
   - Pause game/betting during display
   - Log player response

**Implementation:**

```javascript
class RealityCheck {
  constructor(playerId, intervalMinutes = 60) {
    this.playerId = playerId;
    this.interval = intervalMinutes * 60 * 1000; // Convert to ms
    this.sessionStart = Date.now();
    this.sessionStats = {
      totalWagered: 0,
      totalWon: 0,
      netPosition: 0
    };
    this.startTimer();
  }
  
  startTimer() {
    this.timer = setInterval(() => {
      this.showRealityCheck();
    }, this.interval);
  }
  
  async showRealityCheck() {
    // Pause all game activity
    this.pauseGames();
    
    const sessionDuration = Math.floor((Date.now() - this.sessionStart) / 60000);
    const stats = this.sessionStats;
    
    const message = `
      <h2>Reality Check</h2>
      <p>You have been playing for ${sessionDuration} minutes</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Total wagered: €${stats.totalWagered.toFixed(2)}</li>
        <li>Total won: €${stats.totalWon.toFixed(2)}</li>
        <li>Net position: ${stats.netPosition >= 0 ? '+' : ''}€${stats.netPosition.toFixed(2)}</li>
      </ul>
      <p><a href="/responsible-gaming">Responsible Gaming Tools</a></p>
    `;
    
    // Display modal - cannot be auto-closed
    const response = await showModal(message, {
      buttons: ['Continue Playing', 'Take a Break'],
      dismissable: false
    });
    
    // Log response
    await this.logRealityCheckResponse(response, sessionDuration);
    
    if (response === 'Take a Break') {
      this.endSession();
    } else {
      this.resumeGames();
    }
  }
  
  updateStats(wager, payout) {
    this.sessionStats.totalWagered += wager;
    this.sessionStats.totalWon += payout;
    this.sessionStats.netPosition = this.sessionStats.totalWon - this.sessionStats.totalWagered;
  }
}
```

### 4.4 Problem Gambling Detection & Intervention

**Risk Indicators (Behavioral Markers):**

**Intensity Indicators:**
- Days active per month > 20
- Session duration > 2 hours continuous
- Late-night gambling (11pm-6am)
- Daily gambling for 7+ consecutive days
- 6+ hours total gambling per day

**Financial Indicators:**
- Increasing deposit frequency
- Multiple deposits within 1 hour
- Deposit amount escalation (>50% increase)
- Failed/declined transactions
- Chasing behavior (rapid re-deposits after losses)

**Product Indicators:**
- Migration to higher-risk products (sports → slots)
- Increasing stake sizes
- Reduced time between bets
- Playing multiple games simultaneously

**Risk Scoring Algorithm:**

```python
def calculate_risk_score(player_id, lookback_days=30):
    score = 0
    player_data = get_player_data(player_id, lookback_days)
    
    # Intensity scoring (0-30 points)
    days_active = player_data['days_active']
    if days_active > 25:
        score += 30
    elif days_active > 20:
        score += 20
    elif days_active > 15:
        score += 10
    
    # Financial scoring (0-30 points)
    avg_deposit = player_data['avg_deposit_size']
    deposit_trend = player_data['deposit_trend']  # % change
    if deposit_trend > 100:  # Doubled
        score += 30
    elif deposit_trend > 50:
        score += 20
    elif deposit_trend > 25:
        score += 10
    
    # Session scoring (0-20 points)
    max_session = player_data['max_session_duration']
    if max_session > 240:  # 4+ hours
        score += 20
    elif max_session > 180:
        score += 15
    elif max_session > 120:
        score += 10
    
    # Late-night scoring (0-10 points)
    late_night_sessions = player_data['sessions_between_11pm_6am']
    if late_night_sessions > 10:
        score += 10
    elif late_night_sessions > 5:
        score += 5
    
    # Chasing scoring (0-10 points)
    chasing_episodes = player_data['rapid_redeposits']
    if chasing_episodes > 5:
        score += 10
    elif chasing_episodes > 2:
        score += 5
    
    # Total score 0-100
    return min(score, 100)

def get_risk_level(score):
    if score >= 70:
        return 'critical'
    elif score >= 50:
        return 'high'
    elif score >= 30:
        return 'moderate'
    elif score >= 15:
        return 'low'
    else:
        return 'minimal'
```

**Intervention Framework:**

**Level 1 - Low Risk (Score 15-29):**
- Automated reality checks (every 60 min)
- Educational messages about responsible gaming
- Suggest setting limits
- Weekly activity statement

**Level 2 - Moderate Risk (Score 30-49):**
- Increased reality checks (every 30 min)
- Personalized feedback on spending patterns
- Suggested limit reductions (specific amounts)
- Self-assessment tool prompt
- Reduced marketing communications
- Customer service email outreach

**Level 3 - High Risk (Score 50-69):**
- Mandatory 24-hour cooling-off period
- Temporary limit reductions (25% of current)
- Required customer service contact before resuming
- Blocked from bonuses and promotions
- Enhanced monitoring (daily checks)
- Treatment referral information

**Level 4 - Critical (Score 70+):**
- Immediate account suspension (24-72 hours minimum)
- Mandatory financial assessment
- Required video call with responsible gaming team
- Operator-initiated exclusion considered
- Direct treatment provider referral
- Family contact option (with consent)

**Implementation:**

```python
async def daily_risk_assessment():
    # Run nightly for all active players
    players = get_active_players()
    
    for player in players:
        score = calculate_risk_score(player.id, lookback_days=30)
        previous_score = player.risk_score
        risk_level = get_risk_level(score)
        
        # Update player risk profile
        await update_risk_profile(player.id, score, risk_level)
        
        # Check if intervention needed
        if score > previous_score + 10:  # Significant increase
            await trigger_intervention(player.id, risk_level)
        
        # Level-specific actions
        if risk_level == 'critical':
            await suspend_account(player.id, duration_hours=72)
            await notify_support_team(player.id, score)
            await send_treatment_referral(player.id)
        
        elif risk_level == 'high':
            await initiate_cooling_off(player.id, duration_hours=24)
            await reduce_limits(player.id, reduction_pct=25)
            await schedule_support_call(player.id)
        
        elif risk_level == 'moderate':
            await send_personalized_feedback(player.id, score)
            await suggest_limit_reduction(player.id)
            await prompt_self_assessment(player.id)
        
        elif risk_level == 'low':
            await send_activity_statement(player.id)
```

### 5.4 Performance Optimization Techniques

**Caching Strategy:**

```python
# Three-tier caching
class CacheStrategy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.l1_cache = LocalCache()      # In-memory, 60 seconds
        self.l2_cache = RedisCache()      # Redis, 1 hour
        self.l3_cache = CosmosDB()        # Persistent storage
    
    async def get_player(self, player_id):
        # L1: Check local cache (sub-ms)
        player = self.l1_cache.get(f"player:{player_id}")
        if player:
            return player
        
        # L2: Check Redis (1-2ms)
        player = await self.l2_cache.get(f"player:{player_id}")
        if player:
            self.l1_cache.set(f"player:{player_id}", player, ttl=60)
            return player
        
        # L3: Query Cosmos DB (10-20ms)
        player = await self.l3_cache.query(player_id)
        if player:
            await self.l2_cache.set(f"player:{player_id}", player, ttl=3600)
            self.l1_cache.set(f"player:{player_id}", player, ttl=60)
            return player
        
        return None
```

**Query Optimization:**

```sql
-- BAD: Full scan (100+ RU)
SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.contact.email = 'test@example.rs'

-- GOOD: Lookup container + point read (2 RU)
-- Step 1: Query EmailLookup
SELECT c.playerId FROM EmailLookup c 
WHERE c.email = 'test@example.rs'

-- Step 2: Point read Players
SELECT * FROM Players c WHERE c.id = 'player_abc123'
```

**Connection Pooling:**

```yaml
# Application configuration
database:
  cosmos:
    max_connections: 200
    min_connections: 20
    connection_timeout: 30s
    idle_timeout: 5m
  
  redis:
    pool_size: 100
    max_retries: 3
    retry_backoff: 100ms
  
  sql:
    max_pool_size: 150
    min_pool_size: 10
    connection_lifetime: 5m
```

**Async Processing:**

```python
# Non-critical operations processed asynchronously
@async_handler
async def player_registered(player_id):
    # Fire-and-forget pattern
    await queue.send_message({
        'event': 'player_registered',
        'player_id': player_id
    })
    
    # Immediate return to caller
    return {'status': 'accepted'}

# Background worker
async def process_registration_queue():
    while True:
        message = await queue.receive_message()
        
        # Process in background
        await send_welcome_email(message.player_id)
        await create_analytics_profile(message.player_id)
        await notify_crm_system(message.player_id)
        
        await message.complete()
```

3. **Design for GDPR from day one** - Retrofitting is expensive and risky
4. **Use Cosmos DB partition key `/playerId`** - Optimal for player registry
5. **Deploy multi-region early** - Critical for disaster recovery
6. **Automate GDPR requests** - Volume will increase over time
7. **Engage with Games of Chance Administration proactively** - Build relationship
8. **Implement comprehensive audit logging** - 7-year retention for compliance
9. **Use OAuth 2.0 + mTLS for operators** - Industry standard security
10. **Monitor player risk scores daily** - Early intervention prevents harm

### Don'ts ❌

1. **Don't use email or national ID as partition key** - Creates hot partitions
2. **Don't store plaintext national IDs** - Use hashing or encryption
3. **Don't skip DPIAs for high-risk processing** - Legal requirement
4. **Don't allow self-exclusion revocation during period** - Defeats purpose
5. **Don't implement limit increases without cooling-off** - Player protection failure
6. **Don't neglect Serbian language support** - Local requirement
7. **Don't use cloud services outside Serbia** - Server localization required
8. **Don't build without change feed** - Real-time notifications essential
9. **Don't ignore cache invalidation** - Stale data causes compliance issues
10. **Don't launch without laboratory certification** - License requirement
