Summary
-------

This publication explains how we have used mixed methods research to understand consumer engagement with illegal gambling websites

This is the first in our series of reports on illegal gambling.

The qualitative phase of our research revealed 4 broad audience groups that engage with illegal gambling websites.

These audiences have varying awareness levels of engagement with illegal websites, different entry pathways into the websites, and motivations for using them.
